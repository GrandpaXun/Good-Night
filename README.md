# Good-Night:a sleep-assistant app
---
  Good-Night is an app that is based on objective-c language and runs on an iOS device to help you record your hours and intervals of your sleep. Due to some people may have bad sleep habits while they are not aware of that, we develop this small app to show the user's sleep time every day which can help him find out some problem of his sleep.

### Features
* The app uses a line chart to show user's sleep hours in last week. Users can see the curve and know the change of their sleep hours.
* The app uses a bar chart to show user's sleep hours in this week. Users can see the exact hours of their sleep hours every day until today.
* The app will give the user a tip about their sleep according to their average sleep hours in this week.

### How to use 
* The first scene presented to the user is a table which has two cells. One present the line chart of the user's sleep hours last week and the other show the bar chart of the the user's sleep hours until today this week.
* When you want to add a record of your sleep, tap the button on the top right corner of the fisst scene and you will enter the scond scene which you can input your data by tapping the text field and selecting the start time and end time in the picker view.
* The start time is the time you go to bed and the end time is the time you get up. We strongly recommend you doing this after you getting up.
* When you tap the line chart(or the bar chart), the app will calculate your average sleep hours in last week(or in this week) and give you a report. 

### Notice 
This app is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. We hope the developer remain in this pattern when trying to help us update this app.

### To-Do
We hope the app can analyze the user's sleep data and give the user more than just a average sleep hours report. All the start time and the end time the user inputed is archived and store in the app in case we need. We have serveral next-steps:
* We intend to make this app warn the user if he go to bed to late averagely.
* The app can ask the user to input their sleep quality of their sleep together with sleep time and analyze user's sleep with both. However, we do not know the offcially level of a person's sleep. We are trying to learn about it.
